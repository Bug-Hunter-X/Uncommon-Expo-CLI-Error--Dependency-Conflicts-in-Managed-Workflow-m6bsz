# Uncommon Expo CLI Error: Dependency Conflicts in Managed Workflow

This repository demonstrates a common yet elusive bug encountered when using the Expo CLI with projects employing native modules. The error manifests as vague messages, often masking deeper issues in the project configuration.  This example focuses on scenarios where incompatibility between project dependencies and the Expo managed workflow leads to build failures.  The `expoBug.js` file illustrates problematic code and `expoBugSolution.js` demonstrates the fix.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Attempt to run the project using `expo start` (this should initially fail).
4. Implement the solution in `expoBugSolution.js` and rerun `expo start` to observe the successful build.

## Key Concepts

* Expo Managed Workflow: Limits direct access to native modules.  Requires specific approaches for integration.
* Native Module Compatibility: Not all native modules are compatible with Expo's managed workflow.  Proper configuration or alternative libraries are needed.
* Build Process: Understanding the steps involved in Expo's build process is crucial for resolving these errors.
