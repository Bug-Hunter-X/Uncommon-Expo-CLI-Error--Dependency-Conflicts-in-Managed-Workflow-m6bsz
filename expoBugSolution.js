The solution involves careful review of the project's dependencies and their compatibility with Expo's managed workflow.  If a library requires native code, several approaches can be adopted:

1. **Using Expo-compatible alternatives**: Search for alternative packages specifically designed for Expo or React Native that don't need native module linking.
2. **Ejecting from Expo's managed workflow**:  This gives full access to native modules and the build system, but sacrifices many of Expo's benefits. It's a last resort.
3. **Using EAS Build (or Expo prebuild):**  For complex native module integrations, Expo's EAS Build service (or the older `expo prebuild`) provides a more robust build system that handles complexities of linking native dependencies. This method requires careful setup but remains within the managed workflow.

Example (Illustrative): Let's say the original code in `expoBug.js` uses a library that requires native module linking. The `expoBugSolution.js` might replace that library with an Expo-compatible one, or use EAS Build to configure the linking properly.
