This error occurs when using the Expo CLI with a project that has dependencies that are not compatible with the Expo managed workflow.  Specifically, it often arises when native modules are used that haven't been properly configured for Expo's environment.  The error message itself might be vague, but underlying causes often include issues with linking native libraries, incorrect package versions, or missing build configurations within the project's `ios` and `android` folders.  For instance, a common scenario involves React Native libraries that rely on native code and aren't compatible with Expo's managed workflow without a proper setup with `expo prebuild` or EAS Build.
